<b>Renting out HDD Space</b><br>
Problems:
1. Ever ran out of space on your PC and withheld to do a task?
2. Worried about the security of your data on the cloud despite the promises made by the companies? (A) javascript:nicTemp();
3. Are cloud services affordable?
4. Felt jaded because of the retrieval speed of data from the cloud?
Solutions:
A vast majority of storage devices on PCs and laptops are operating at less than 25% capacity. In our proposed concept, host can rent out his hard disk space and get paid for it without any middlemen. We use blockchain to store the data of renter at a reasonable cost. Renters’ data is broken down into smaller units and stored on different hosts’ PCs. Renter can pay by cash-wallets or crypto-currencies. All the data on the blockchain will be immutable and protected by a secure cipher and thus data remains unharmed.
Impact:
Our idea will affect general public, especially at a time when the need for data privacy and security is at an all time high. The day to day struggle of running out of space will come to an end in a much cheap, safe and transparent method than anything this world has seen thus far.
